Zone	Recommended Structure	Why
Hand	Dynamic Array (e.g., ArrayList)	Small, fixed-size; fast random access.
Library	Linked List	Dynamic size; efficient shuffling and drawing.
Graveyard	Linked List (Stack Style)	Efficient LIFO behavior for interactions with the top card.
Battlefield	Hash Table	Quick lookups for card state and effects; cards can be uniquely indexed.
